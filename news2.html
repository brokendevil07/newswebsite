                India beat England by 151 runs at Lord's despite the hosts dominating much of it Shami and Bumrah put up 89 runs for the ninth wicket to all but eliminate any chances of an England win The last England wicket fell with just under eight overs to go in
                the day.<br> <br>

                <br> Former fast bowler Zaheer Khan said that India's win over England in the second Test at Lord's will go down as a milestone for the team. India turned things around in the first session of the fifth day and bowled out England in the
                next two sessions to take a 1-0 lead in the five-match series.<br> <br>"Even on the fourth day evening you wouldn't have imagined the match would turn out to eb like this. The way they have comeback, I think this Test will be talked about
                for many days. A memorable Test and you get to see these sort of comebacks very rarely," Zaheer said on Cricbuzz. Tail-enders Mohammed Shami and Jasprit Bumrah put up 89 runs for the ninth wicket to all but eliminate any chances of an
                England win. India's fast bowlers then dismissed the England batting lineup in an intense second and third session at Lord's, with the last wicket falling with just under eight overs to go in the day. "Everyone was hoping that Pant would
                stay for a long period.<br> <br> But the way Shami and Bumrah made that partnership, India were dictating the game after that. And then just brilliant bowling," said Zaheer.</p>
            <p>"The entire team came together on the field and wanted to win it. You could see that from everyone's body language. Whoever watched this match, I don't they would have enjoyed a Test match as much as this. This victory is a huge milestone
                for India," he said.
